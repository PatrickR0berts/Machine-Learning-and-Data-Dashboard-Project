Trying to create a programmatic way of creating a dashboard to show certain economic statistics.

Might try push the database location to Azure, just to learn more about Azure, and to get a chance to learn DevOps too.

Might then find a way to post this insight on social media using AI to word the post, given the findings.

Realistically though, I could do this all in Python locally, but where is the fun in that?

Will then try to provide some sort of reccomendations through a Power BI report and dashboard.
